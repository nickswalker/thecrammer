A simple Laravel web application to quiz vocabulary.

* Automatically focuses in on most missed words
* Pulls from the Quizlet API
* Gives you stats on each set that you practice
* Great mobile interface

I originally built this in the summer before my junior year of high school to cram for PSAT vocabulary. I got a perfect score on the critical reading section and the writing section because of it.

Installation
----

Unzip the download into directory on your server. Run composer update. Point your browser to the public directory. Works great with a Vagrant VM too.

Usage
----

Enter the ID of a Quizlet set and cram away.
